        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
        type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
        several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such
        as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        asagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella
        cheese, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork or chicken), and
        vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish
        is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano.

    <!-- ingredients -->
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>
        1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- procedures -->
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
